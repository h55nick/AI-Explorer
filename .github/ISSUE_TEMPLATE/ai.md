## Implementation Notes
- Write the implementation with the minimal amount of code necessary to meet the requirements.
- Prioritize simplicity over complexity.
- Do not use any additional packages; only standard libraries should be used.
- Avoid using `isinstance`, `getattr`, `hasattr`, etc. Be strict about the types passed into methods. You do not need to maintain backward compatibility in method signatures if you control all call sites and can update the inputs as needed.
- Review your work carefully and incorporate any relevant additional context.

## Workflow
- Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) outlining the conceptual steps you will take before starting substantive work.
- Branch Naming Convention: `fix/issue-###/short-description`
